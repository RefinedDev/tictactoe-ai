Yes, this is quite hardcoded, but i'm still learning Rust. I started learning it like 1 week ago.

# How to run
This thing has command arguments so you would have to do something like.

`cargo run -args`
or
`..exe -args`

To make this work, you have to pass your tictactoe character, either **X** or **O**

`cargo run [X or O]`
or
`..exe [X or O]`

# Help
Use `help` to see how to use this absolute piece of crap.

`cargo run help`
or
`..exe help`


Thanks for visiting ðŸ˜‰.
